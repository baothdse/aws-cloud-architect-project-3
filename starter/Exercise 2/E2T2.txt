Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. AWS Config
    - Both instances are attached public IP address, we should disassociate these Elastic IP Address to avoid potential
    security risk and cost increasing.
    - We should change HTTTP to HTTPS
    - Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) encryption is not enabled by default => turn on encryption for EBS.
    - CloudFormation stacks do not send event notifications to an SNS topic => turn on notification and define topic
    for sending event notification to SNS
    - "Access log" attribute of Application Load Balancer is turned off => Turn on and define bucket for logging.
    - "Deletion Protection" of ALB is turned off => turn on.

2. AWS Security Hub
    - Hardware MFA should be enabled for the root user => turn on MFA for root user.
    - Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port xxxxx => should allow ingress from
    specific IP address
    - VPC default security groups should not allow inbound or outbound traffic => restrict all traffic in default security group
    - IAM password does not met the policies => follow AWS IAM password policies to reset IAM password
    - VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs => turn all VPV flow log
