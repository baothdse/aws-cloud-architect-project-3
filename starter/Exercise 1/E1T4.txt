Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The CIDR of security groups (WebAppSG, AppLoadBalancerSG and AttackInstanceSG) should not be setting as 0.0.0.0/0
to prevent connection from unwanted sources. We should indicate specific source IP Address or Security Group in our rule.

For example: we can specify "Source" by Security Group ID of AppLoadBalancerSG and "Port Range" by 5000 for. This allows
our Web service instance receives connection only from the instance, which is attached "AppLoadBalancerSG" (in this case,
it's our Application Load Balancer)


# Poor practice 2
As we can see, both Web App Instance and Attack Instance are attached an Instance Role, which allows instance to do all
action to S3 Service. We should follow least priviledge principle by limit the action that we added to policy. In this
case, we just only need to grant Get action on FreeRecipe buckit in InstanceRolePolicy.
